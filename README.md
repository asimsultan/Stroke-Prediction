# Stroke Disease Prediction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status.


In the given notebook file, I have done some data manipulation since the dataset is highly imbalanced by using SMOTE analysis to oversample the data with less output labels and applied RandomForestClassifier to predict the patients.

The app has been deployed using Flask and Heroku.
The live demo of the project is here:
